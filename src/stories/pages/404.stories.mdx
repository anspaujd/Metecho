# 404

**Indicates that the page requested can't be found.**

## Overview

The **404** component is a page that indicates that the user reached the domain
they requested but the URL path provided no information.

The component consists of an illustration, an emoticon of a person shrugging,
and a message indicating the invalid address that should also guide the user to
a valid page on the site.

## Guidelines

Typically, a custom `message` provides meaningful information on how to recover
from an error -- for example, after navigating to an **Epic** or **Task** that
doesn't exist.

<Story id="pages-404-components--four-oh-four" />

If a custom message is not provided, then the default message is displayed with
a link to the home page.

<Story id="pages-404-components--empty-four-oh-four" />
